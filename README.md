Operational and Performance Monitoring Platform

Project Overview
This project is a full-stack operational and performance monitoring platform designed to capture, store, and display metrics in real-time. It provides insights into system performance and activity through a Flask-based backend and a React frontend. Containerization with Docker ensures consistency and portability across development, testing, and deployment environments.

Features
- RESTful API** built with Flask for data submission, retrieval, and insight generation.
- React-based frontend** for user interaction and data visualization.
- SQLite database** for initial data storage, managed by SQLAlchemy.
- Containerized** using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy deployment.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** enabled for secure communication between frontend and backend.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Installation and Setup

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-react-spa.git
cd flask-react-spa

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend

Ensure requirements.txt is in place with all dependencies:

bash
Copy code
Flask==2.x.x
Flask-CORS==3.x.x
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.x.x

Build the Docker image for the backend:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t backend-image .

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend

Build the Docker image for the frontend:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t frontend-image .

4. Run the Application with Docker Compose
Navigate back to the root directory and run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This command will start both the backend and frontend services.

Accessing the Application
Frontend: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Backend API: The API is accessible at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
1. /api/metrics (POST)
Description: Submits new metric data.
Payload:
json
Copy code
{
  "metric_name": "CPU Usage",
  "value": 75
}

2. /api/metrics (GET)
Description: Retrieves all stored metrics.
Response:
json
Copy code
[
  {
    "metric_name": "CPU Usage",
    "value": 75,
    "timestamp": "2023-01-01 12:00:00"
  }
]

3. /api/insights (GET)
Description: Provides performance insights based on stored metrics.
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "total_metrics_collected": 100,
  "average_metric_value": 70,
  "suggested_action": "Maintain current process with periodic reviews"
}

Environment Configuration
Set up environment variables as needed, such as:

FLASK_ENV: Set to development, testing, or production.
SECRET_KEY: For session security.

Future Enhancements
Database Upgrade: Transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better scalability.
Security: Add JWT authentication for secure API access.
Advanced Monitoring: Integrate with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive metrics tracking.

Troubleshooting
Port Conflicts: Ensure ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend) are not used by other applications.
Docker Issues: Run docker-compose down to stop and remove containers, then docker-compose up to restart.
